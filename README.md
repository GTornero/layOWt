**layOWt** is a Python library aimed at performing multi-disciplinary
layout optimisation of offshore wind farms considering topics such as:

- Variation of the wind climate in the wind farm site
- Wake effects between turbines
- Spatial constraints
- Foundation costs based on:
    - Bathymetry
    - Ground conditions
- More to come...
